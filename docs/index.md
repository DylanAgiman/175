### Summary

Our project will take sound as input, specifically music in MIDI file format. The output will be music generated from our model and played in the Malmo environment using note blocks. The goal of this project is to generate music that is inspired by the music that the model trained on. For example, if the model is trained on Bach's music, the music generated will be similar to Bach's. If the model trained on Bach's and Mozart's music, the music generated will be influenced by both composers.
