## Summary of the Project 
Our project will take sound as input. This can for example be songs or humming from humans. The output will be music note blocks in the Malmo environment that recreate the given sound (e.g. song) in the Minecraft world. Ideally, the music blocks in the Minecraft world will resemble the given sound very closely. 

## AI/ML Algorithms 
- Reinforcement Learning 
- Q-learning 

## Evaluation Plan
The success of our project will focus primarily on the ability of the AI to recreate sounds in Minecraft based on inputted sounds. The metrics for this project will be the difference between the inputted sounds and the resulting output, be that pitch, intensity, or timing. The reinforcement learning aspect of the project should allow the AI to improve the metrics by adjusting the pitches of the generated sounds to match the input, resulting in a greater reward. <br>
For a basic sanity test, we can feed a simple four-note song to the AI to see if it can match the correct pitch to the input sounds given a relatively clear and simple case. <br>
We should be able to discern progress towards the final goal by listening to the sounds being produced; if the sounds are completely incorrect, or if no progress is being made towards the ideal sounds, the algorithm might not be working as intended. <br>
